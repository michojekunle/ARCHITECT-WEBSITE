## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3 
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [Vanilla-tilt](https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/) - JS library

### What I learned

In the course of this Project as Interesting and Refreshing as it was, I grabbed a few Important concepts such as:
- Effectively Building Responsive websites and apps with vanilla css.
- Utilizing Vanilla-tilt.js to add interesing tilt effects to the teams section of the project. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <a href='#' data-content='home'></a>
  <div class="card" data-tilt-glare data-tilt-max-glare="0.8"></div>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css 
  a::after {
    content: attr(data-content);
  }

```
<!-- ```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
} -->

### Continued development
```
Going forward, I'll be working on more animated, responsive, dynamic and interactive websites with vanilla CSS and other CSS & JS Libraries.
```


### Useful resources

- [Resource 1 (The Effect on mouse Over)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqEmFSlx4ps) - This helped me for understand vanill-tilt.js and building this effect from scratch. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Resource 2 (Customizing Scrollbar)](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/s/scrollbar/) - This is an amazing article. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
